You are given an image file that contains a maze.

Inside the maze you will find a red circle and red square.
The circle denotes the starting location in the maze and the square is the end.
The square is 17x17 pixels, the circle is also 17x17.
The there will be no entrance or exit to the maze (border goes all the way around)
The background color will always be white, any color other than red or white 
is considered a wall and you cannot pass through it.

Create a node js app that can solve the maze and draw a blue line 
from the starting circle to the ending square and create an image of the solution as mazesolution.jpg
